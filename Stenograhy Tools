Steganography - A list of useful tools and resourcesPermalink
SteganographyPermalink

Steganography is hiding a file or a message inside of another file , there are many fun steganography CTF challenges out there where the flag is hidden in an image , audio file or even other types of files. Here is a list of the most tools I use and some other useful resources.

SteghidePermalink

Steghide is a steganography program that hides data in various kinds of image and audio files , only supports these file formats : JPEG, BMP, WAV and AU. but it’s also useful for extracting embedded and encrypted data from other files.

StegsolvePermalink

Sometimes there is a message or a text hidden in the image itself and in order to view it you need to apply some color filters or play with the color levels. You can do it with GIMP or Photoshop or any other image editing software but stegsolve made it easier. it’s a small java tool that applies many color filters on images. Personally i find it very useful.
You can get it from github
StringsPermalink

Strings is a linux tool that displays printable strings in a file. That simple tool can be very helpful when solving stego challenges. Usually the embedded data is password protected or encrypted and sometimes the password is actaully in the file itself and can be easily viewed by using strings. It’s a default linux tool so you don’t need to install anything.

Useful commands:
strings file : displays printable strings in the given file.
